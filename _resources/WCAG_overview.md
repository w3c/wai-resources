roadmap: # As many pairs of data as you want (first pair -> next stage in the tool)
  - date: 2016/Q2
    stage: Minor Update
  - date: 2016/Q3
    stage: draft
note: Given the high number of hits this gets, and it's outdatedness (doesn't link to new resources such as Tutorials & Getting Started), I think it's a medium-high priority to at least do a minor update.
